# üöÄ Tres Lenguajes - Inspired by Code With Antonio

A Duo Lingo Clone.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

This project is built with the following tech:

### Next.js 14

[Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) is the latest release of the popular React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

### Server Actions

Server Actions in Next.js allow developers to write server-side logic that can be directly called from the client. This simplifies building interactive applications by reducing the need for additional serverless functions or configuring backend routes.

### Drizzle

Drizzle is an emerging TypeScript ORM tool that offers several advantages over Prisma. While Prisma is known for its type safety and easy-to-use API, Drizzle offers a more flexible and extensible solution, specifically when handling complex queries with multiple JOINs.

### Clerk

[Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is a service that handles authentication and user management for modern applications. It seamlessly integrates with any technology stack and simplifies securing and personalizing user experiences.

### Shadcn

[Shadcn](https://shadcn.com/) is a component library for React that allows developers to quickly build beautiful and responsive UIs with a design-first approach. It offers a range of customizable components that are easy to implement.

## üîãFeatures

List down the features of your project here. For example:

- Secure login system using Clerk
- Dynamic pages and API routes with Next.js Server Actions
- Beautiful UI components from Shadcn
- Drizzle ORM for handling complex database queries
